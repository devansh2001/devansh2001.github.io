DEVANSH JATIN PONDA

I'm an undergraduate second-year Computer Science major at the Georgia Institute
of Technology. I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and
making the world a better place.

I was born in India, raised in Kuwait, and am currently
pursuing my education in the United States, and thus I have interacted with
people with different backgrounds. My experiences in not only being a member of,
but also leading teams of such diverse individuals has shown to me that the best
of ideas come from the most diverse teams.

I find myself drawn to two fields in Computer Science the most: Cloud
Infrastructure, and Artificial Intelligence. I have had past experience in
developing both technologies at the industrial level, and I'm always looking
to learn more.
